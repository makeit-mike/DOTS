# DOTS

I am currently hopping around between many systems, I am hoping to consolidate everything soon. 

1. macOS (M1 Pro 16in, M1 Max 14in)
    Mostly professional programming. (Haskell, Swift)

2. Arch Linux (Framework Laptop, DWM)
    Mostly personal programming, trying out new languages. (Rust, Haskell, Clojure)

3. Windows 10 (Ryzen 9 5950x, RTX 3070; Ubuntu WSL2)
    Mostly gaming and some windows specific programming (C#, C++)
